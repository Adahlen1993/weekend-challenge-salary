Weekend Challenge Salary Calculator

## Description

I built a table that updates as a new employee(inputs) are added to it. This table calculates a total monthly expense that when reaching a certain number(in this case greater than 20000) turns red. It also has the option to delete added (employee) from the table and update the total expenses at the bottom.
